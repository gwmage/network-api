The `User` entity has been updated to include the following properties:

*   `region`: string (e.g., "US", "Europe")
*   `preferences`: string[] (e.g., ["outdoor activities", "online gaming"])
*   `interests`: string[] (e.g., ["technology", "travel"])

These properties will be used by the matching algorithm to group users with similar characteristics.  The current implementation of the matching algorithm is a placeholder that groups users into groups of 5 without considering their region, preferences, or interests.  A future update will implement the weighted matching logic based on these properties.

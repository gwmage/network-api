The user instruction is undefined.  Based on the context provided (README.md, package.json, app.module.ts, and git logs), the task is to implement two new API endpoints: `/matching` (POST) to manually trigger the user matching process and `/matching/status` (GET) to retrieve the status of the matching process.  This includes creating the controller, service, module, tests, and updating the README.md file with documentation for these endpoints.  The automated matching process, running every Sunday at midnight, is already configured in `schedule.config.ts` and needs to be verified.

## Docker Registry Authentication Issue on Railway

The deployment is failing because the Railway environment is unable to authenticate with the Docker registry to pull the necessary base image (`node:16-alpine`). This is indicated by the consistent "401 Unauthorized" error in the build logs.

This issue is *not* a problem with your project's code, but rather a configuration problem within the Railway environment.

**Recommended Steps:**

1. **Check your Railway project settings:** Ensure that your Railway project is correctly linked to a Docker registry with appropriate credentials. If using the default Docker Hub, make sure your Docker Hub credentials are configured in your Railway account or project settings.
2. **Verify Docker Hub access:** If you are using a private Docker Hub image or a private registry, double-check that the credentials you've provided have the necessary permissions to pull the `node:16-alpine` image.
3. **Contact Railway support:** If you are unable to resolve the issue through the project settings, contact Railway support for assistance. They can help diagnose and fix any platform-specific authentication problems.
4. **Build locally and push if using a private base image:** If the issue persists, you can build the docker image locally, after successfully authenticating with docker, and then push the image to a registry that is connected to your Railway deployment.

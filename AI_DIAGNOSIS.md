# Railway Deployment: Docker Image Pull Failure

The Railway deployment is failing due to an authentication issue when pulling the `node:16` Docker image. The error message "`ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: node:16: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/node:16: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/node/manifests/16: 401 Unauthorized`" indicates a problem with Railway's access to the Docker registry.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Check Railway Project Settings:** Verify the Docker registry configuration in your Railway project settings. Ensure that the necessary credentials or access tokens are correctly configured.

2. **Contact Railway Support:** If the issue persists after checking the project settings, contact Railway support and provide them with the error message.  This problem likely requires intervention on their end to resolve the authentication issue with the Docker registry.

The Railway deployment is failing because the environment lacks the necessary credentials to pull the `node:16` Docker image from the Docker registry.  The error message "401 Unauthorized" consistently appears in the logs, indicating an authentication problem.

Modifying the Dockerfile or project code will *not* fix this issue, as it's a platform-level configuration problem on Railway.

**Recommended Action:**

1. Verify that your Railway project is correctly linked to your Docker Hub account (or any private registry you are using).  Check the Railway dashboard settings for Docker registry integration.
2. If the link exists, double-check the credentials.  It's possible the access token or other authentication details are incorrect or have expired.
3. Contact Railway support for assistance if the problem persists. Provide them with the error message and any relevant configuration details.
4. As a workaround, consider using a public base image that doesn't require authentication if possible, though this may introduce compatibility issues depending on your project's dependencies.

The deployment is failing due to an authentication issue when pulling the `node:16` Docker image from the registry. The error message `401 Unauthorized` indicates that the Railway environment lacks the necessary credentials or configuration to authenticate with the Docker registry (registry-1.docker.io).

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Check Railway's Docker Registry Settings:** Verify that your Railway project is correctly configured to authenticate with the Docker registry. This might involve setting up a Docker registry integration or providing credentials for a private registry.
2. **Consult Railway Documentation:** Refer to the Railway documentation on Docker registry authentication for specific instructions and troubleshooting steps.
3. **Contact Railway Support:** If the issue persists, contact Railway support for assistance with resolving the authentication problem.

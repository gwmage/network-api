The Docker build is consistently failing with a "401 Unauthorized" error when attempting to pull the `node:16` base image. This indicates a credentials issue within the Railway deployment environment.  Modifying the `Dockerfile` will not resolve this as it's an external authentication problem.

**Recommended Manual Actions:**

1. **Check Railway Docker Hub Integration:** Verify that your Railway project is correctly integrated with your Docker Hub account and that the necessary credentials are configured.
2. **Railway Support:**  If the issue persists, contact Railway support and provide them with the error message ("401 Unauthorized") for further assistance. They may need to check their internal configurations related to Docker image pulls.

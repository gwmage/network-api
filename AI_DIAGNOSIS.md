The Docker build is failing due to an authentication error when trying to pull the `node:16` base image.  The error message `"401 Unauthorized"` indicates a credentials problem.

This issue is *not* caused by any code within your repository. It is a problem with the Railway deployment environment's access to the Docker registry.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Check Railway's documentation:** Look for documentation on how to configure Docker credentials or registry authentication within the Railway platform.
2. **Contact Railway support:** If you can't find a solution in the documentation, contact Railway support and report the `401 Unauthorized` error when pulling the `node:16` image. They should be able to assist with the credential configuration in their environment.
3. **Verify Docker Hub Credentials (if applicable):**  If your project relies on private Docker Hub images, ensure your Docker Hub credentials are correctly configured within your Railway project settings.

Once the credential issue on the Railway platform is resolved, the build should proceed without this error.

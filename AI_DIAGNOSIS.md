## Diagnosis: Docker Image Pull Authorization Failure

The Railway deployment is consistently failing due to an authentication error (401 Unauthorized) when attempting to pull the `node:16` base image from the Docker registry.  This indicates a problem with the Railway environment's credentials or configuration for accessing the Docker registry, rather than an issue within the project's code.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Verify Docker Hub Credentials:** Ensure that your Docker Hub credentials are correctly configured within your Railway project settings. This typically involves linking your Railway account to your Docker Hub account or providing the necessary access tokens.
2. **Check Railway Project Settings:** Review your Railway project's environment variables and settings related to Docker image pulls.  There might be specific configuration options for authentication that need to be adjusted.
3. **Contact Railway Support:** If the issue persists after verifying your credentials and project settings, contact Railway support for assistance.  They may have insights into specific authentication issues or environment configurations that could be causing the problem.
4. **Consider Alternative Base Images (Temporary):** As a temporary workaround, you could try using a different base image that doesn't require authentication, such as a publicly available image from a different registry.  However, this is not a long-term solution and should be addressed by resolving the underlying credential issue with Railway.

**Previous Attempts:**

Multiple attempts to resolve this issue by modifying the `Dockerfile` have been unsuccessful, confirming that the problem lies outside the project's codebase. The error message "401 Unauthorized" consistently points to an authentication failure within the Railway environment.

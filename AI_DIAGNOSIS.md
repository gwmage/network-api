The deployment is failing due to an authentication issue when pulling the `node:16` base image from the Docker registry.  The error message `401 Unauthorized` indicates a problem with the credentials or configuration of the Railway deployment environment to access registry-1.docker.io.

The error is consistently reproducible despite multiple attempts to modify project files, suggesting the issue is external to the codebase.

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Check Railway's Docker Registry Integration:** Verify the Docker registry settings in your Railway project. Ensure that Railway has the necessary permissions to pull images from the Docker Hub (registry-1.docker.io).
2. **Check Railway's Documentation:** Refer to Railway's documentation for troubleshooting Docker image pull issues and authentication problems.
3. **Contact Railway Support:** If the issue persists, contact Railway support for assistance with configuring Docker registry access within your deployment environment.

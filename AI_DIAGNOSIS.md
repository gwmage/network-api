# Unresolvable Docker Image Pull Error (401 Unauthorized)

The deployment consistently fails due to an authentication error (401 Unauthorized) when attempting to pull the `node:16` Docker image. This indicates an issue with the Railway deployment environment's access credentials to the Docker registry.

Modifications to the `Dockerfile` have not resolved the problem, suggesting the issue lies outside the project's codebase.

**Recommended Action:**

1. Contact Railway support and provide them with the error logs, highlighting the recurring \"401 Unauthorized\" error when pulling the `node:16` image.
2. Request assistance in resolving the authentication issue on their end, as this is a platform-level problem.
3. Once Railway confirms the authentication problem is fixed, re-attempt the deployment.

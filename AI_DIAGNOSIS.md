The Railway deployment is failing due to an authentication error when attempting to pull the `node:16` Docker image.  The error message "401 Unauthorized" indicates that the Railway environment lacks the necessary credentials to access the Docker registry (`registry-1.docker.io`).

This issue is external to the application code and requires manual intervention within the Railway platform settings.  Here's the recommended action:

1. **Verify Docker Hub Credentials:** Ensure that your Docker Hub credentials are correctly configured in your Railway project settings. You may need to link your Railway account to your Docker Hub account or provide an access token with sufficient permissions to pull the required image.
2. **Check Railway Documentation:** Consult the Railway documentation for specific instructions on configuring Docker registry authentication within their platform.  There might be specific environment variables or secrets that need to be set.
3. **Contact Railway Support:** If you have verified your credentials and followed the Railway documentation but the issue persists, contact Railway support for assistance. They can help troubleshoot any platform-specific configuration problems that may be preventing access to the Docker registry.

## Diagnosis of Railway Deployment Failure

The Railway deployment is consistently failing due to an authentication issue when attempting to pull the `node:16` Docker image. The error message `"ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: node:16: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/node:16: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/node/manifests/16: 401 Unauthorized"` clearly indicates a problem with credentials or access rights within the Railway environment.

This issue **cannot** be resolved by modifying the application code or configuration files within the repository. It requires action at the Railway platform level.

**Recommended Solution:**

1. **Verify Docker Hub Credentials:** Ensure that your Docker Hub credentials are correctly configured within your Railway project settings. This typically involves setting up a Docker Hub integration or providing access tokens.
2. **Check Railway Documentation:** Consult the Railway documentation for troubleshooting Docker image pull authentication issues. There may be specific instructions or settings related to Docker Hub integration.
3. **Contact Railway Support:** If the problem persists, contact Railway support directly for assistance with configuring Docker Hub authentication within your project.

Creating a `.dockerignore` file or modifying the `Dockerfile` will *not* resolve this issue as the root cause is external to the repository.

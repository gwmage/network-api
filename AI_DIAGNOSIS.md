# Docker Registry Authentication Issue

The Railway deployment is failing because the build environment is unable to authenticate with the Docker registry to pull the necessary 'node:16' base image. The error message "401 Unauthorized" indicates a credentials problem.

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Check your Railway project's settings:** Ensure that the necessary credentials or authentication tokens for accessing the Docker registry (registry-1.docker.io) are correctly configured within your Railway project settings.  This may involve linking your Docker Hub account or providing registry credentials.
2.  **If using a private registry:** Verify that the registry URL is correct and the credentials for accessing the registry are set up in your Railway project. If using a public image try using node:lts.
3. **Contact Railway support:** If you are unable to resolve the authentication issue, consider contacting Railway support for assistance in configuring the Docker registry access within your project.

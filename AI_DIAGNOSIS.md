The Docker build is consistently failing with a `401 Unauthorized` error when attempting to pull the `node:16` base image. This indicates a problem with authenticating with the Docker registry (`registry-1.docker.io`).  Modifying the `Dockerfile` will not resolve this issue, as the problem lies in the deployment environment's access permissions.

**Recommended Manual Actions:**

1. **Connect Docker Hub to Railway:** The simplest solution is to connect your Docker Hub account to your Railway project. This allows Railway to use your credentials to pull the image.

2. **Configure Docker Registry Credentials:**  If you are using a private registry or a different Docker account for the image, you will need to manually configure the Docker registry credentials in your Railway project's deployment settings.  This typically involves setting environment variables for the registry username, password, and potentially registry URL, depending on your specific setup.

Please consult the Railway documentation for detailed instructions on how to connect your Docker Hub account or configure Docker registry credentials within your project's settings.

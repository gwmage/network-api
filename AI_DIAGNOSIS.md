The Docker build is failing because the Railway deployment environment is unable to authenticate with the Docker registry to pull the `node:16` base image. The error "401 Unauthorized" indicates a credentials problem.

This issue cannot be resolved by modifying the project's code. It requires adjusting the Railway project settings to grant the necessary permissions.

**Recommended steps:**

1. **Check Docker Hub Credentials:** Ensure you have valid Docker Hub credentials. If you're using a private image, verify that the necessary secrets are set up correctly within your project settings on Railway. If it's a public image, this error is unusual and may indicate a temporary issue with the registry or Railway's connection to it.

2. **Link Docker Hub to Railway:** If you haven't already, link your Docker Hub account to your Railway project. This can typically be done in the project's settings. There may be a specific section for configuring Docker registry access where you can provide your username and password, or an access token, as needed.

3. **Check Railway Project Settings:** Double-check your project settings on Railway for any misconfigurations related to Docker or image pulling. Make sure there are no conflicting settings that might be overriding your credentials.

4. **Contact Railway Support:** If you've verified your credentials and settings, and the issue persists, contact Railway support and provide the error message from the logs. They should be able to assist with troubleshooting any platform-specific authentication or network problems.

5. **Use Railway Base Image:** If pulling custom images repeatedly fails, try using the `node:16` base image provided through the Railway buildpacks. By selecting this pre-configured image from the Railway project options, you offload the image pulling to Railway, which reduces the possibility of authentication issues.

6. **Switch Base Images:** If you suspect problems with the `node:16` image itself, try switching to a more specific version (e.g., `node:16.18`) or an alternative distribution based on a different Linux distribution (e.g., node:16-alpine) if compatibility with your application allows.
